### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My career started in 2011, with the beginning of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at UNIVALI â€“ Universidade do Vale do ItajaÃ­ and the first commercial opportunity to work with software development. I have accumulated experience in the area of software development, focused on the analysis, planning and coding of enterprise-level applications for different market niches. Throughout my career, I have been working with PHP and JavaScript.

After acquiring commercial experience, I founded Volm, a company focused on digital marketing and enterprise-level applications. I was responsible for strategic and technical management, as well as for understanding and collecting customer requirements and participating in the entire lifecycle of digital projects. In 2019, I closed Volm in order to move to Ireland and pursue an ambitious dream: living and working abroad.

I have a huge passion for knowledge, always looking for new technologies and content because I believe that a software engineer must overcome technology barriers. I am currently studying JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Node.js and other technical content. I also like to read about project management and software engineering, travel to different places, listen to music and podcasts, and watch TV shows and movies.
